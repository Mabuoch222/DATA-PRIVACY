# üîê Hashing in Cryptography

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

**Hashing** is a process used in cryptography to convert data (like a file, password, or message) into a fixed-size string of characters, called a **hash** or **digest**. Hashing is commonly used to check data integrity, store passwords securely, and support many security systems.

Hashing is not encryption. Unlike encryption, hashed data **cannot be reversed back** to its original form.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Why We Use Hashing ?

* **üîç Data Integrity** ‚Äì Detects if files or messages have been changed.
* **üîë Password Security** ‚Äì Passwords are stored as hashes instead of plaintext.
* **‚úçÔ∏è Digital Signatures** ‚Äì Hashes are used in signing messages for authenticity.
* **‚ö° Efficient Lookup** ‚Äì Hashes help with fast data comparison and indexing.
* **‚õìÔ∏è Blockchain** ‚Äì Blocks are linked using cryptographic hashes.
* **üì¶ Software Verification** ‚Äì Ensures downloaded files are not tampered.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ How Hash Functions Work

### Basic Flow

```
Input Data ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Hash Function ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Fixed-Length Hash Output
```

A **hash function** takes an input (message, file, password) and returns a fixed-length output (the hash). The output:

* Looks random.
* Changes completely even if you change just one letter in the input.
* Even a **tiny change** in the input gives a **completely different hash**.
* Always gives the same output for the same input.

Example:

* Input: `"hello"`
* Output: `2cf24dba5fb0a...` (SHA-256 hash)

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Hashing Algorithms: Construction Styles
- Hashing algorithms can be built in different ways. Some common styles:

   | Construction Style                   | Description                                                                           | Examples                              | Use Cases / Notes                                                             |
   | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd**                   | Splits input into fixed-size blocks, processes with a compression function.           | MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2                     | Classic design, vulnerable to length extension attacks if not used with care. |
   | **Sponge Construction**              | Absorbs input bit-by-bit into an internal state, then "squeezes" output.              | SHA-3 (Keccak)                        | Flexible output length, strong security, resistant to extension attacks.      |
   | **HAIFA (Hash Iterative Framework)** | Enhancement of Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd with additional input parameters (e.g., salt, counter). | BLAKE, BLAKE2                         | Adds resistance to some known weaknesses of Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd.                   |
   | **Wide-Pipe**                        | Uses larger internal state than the output size to prevent collisions.                | Whirlpool, SHA-512/256                | Offers better collision resistance.                                           |
   | **Tree Hashing / Merkle Trees**      | Splits data into chunks, hashes them, and combines using a binary tree structure.     | BLAKE3, Parallel SHA, Merkle Trees    | Enables parallel processing, ideal for large data sets or blockchain.         |
   | **Feedforward Construction**         | Combines the input with the output of the compression function at each step.          | RIPEMD, Tiger                         | Adds security layer to Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd.                                        |
   | **Domain Separation Construction**   | Processes different parts of input (like key, data, salt) separately.                 | HMAC, TupleHash                       | Prevents cross-domain collision issues.                                       |
   | **Random Oracle Model-based**        | Theoretical model assuming hash acts like a black-box random function.                | Cryptographic proofs, protocol design | Not practical implementation but used in security proofs.                     |
   | **Permutation-Based Hashing**        | Uses permutations (rather than compression) to transform data.                        | Keccak (SHA-3), Gimli                 | Often used in lightweight and sponge constructions.                           |
   | **Compression Function Chaining**    | Chaining a core compression function over input blocks.                               | MD4 family (MD5, SHA-1)               | Foundation of early hash designs.                                             |
   | **Rate + Capacity Model (Sponge)**   | Two-phase: absorb input at ‚Äúrate‚Äù, output based on ‚Äúcapacity‚Äù.                        | SHA-3, KangarooTwelve                 | Enables variable-length hash output and high flexibility.                     |

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Hash-Based Cryptographic Primitives

- **Hash-Based Cryptographic Primitives** are cryptographic techniques that use the core properties of hash functions to provide secure features like authentication, key generation, and digital signatures. They're efficient, often quantum-resistant, and form the backbone of modern cryptographic protocols.

- Instead of relying on complex math (like prime factorization or elliptic curves), these primitives achieve security mainly through the properties of **cryptographic hash functions** ‚Äî especially collision resistance, preimage resistance, and determinism.

### üß© Key Characteristics

   * Based on **well-established hash functions** (e.g., SHA-2, SHA-3, BLAKE2).
   * Often more **efficient and post-quantum secure** than traditional cryptographic primitives.
   * Generally **simpler to implement** and audit.
   * Can be **stateless** and avoid key reuse issues.

---

### üîí Security Based on Hash Properties

These primitives **do not require asymmetric key cryptography** and their security relies on the hardness of:

* Finding a **preimage** (i.e., input from a given hash).
* Finding **collisions** (two inputs with same hash).
* Ensuring the **integrity and authenticity** of data.

---

### ‚úÖ Advantages

* Often faster than traditional cryptographic methods.
* Easier to implement securely.
* Minimal reliance on complex algebra or number theory.

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Password Hashing (Important Distinction)

Hashing passwords is different from regular hashing.

* **Regular Hashing** (e.g., SHA-256) is **not safe** for passwords.
* Use **slow, salted** hashing algorithms for passwords:

  * **Salt**: A random value added to the password before hashing to prevent attackers from using precomputed hash tables.
  * **Slow algorithms**: Make brute-force attacks harder.

| Algorithm  | Key Feature                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **bcrypt** | Slows down attackers; salt built-in.                         |
| **scrypt** | Memory-hard, resists GPU/ASIC attacks.                       |
| **Argon2** | Winner of Password Hashing Competition (PHC); highly secure. |

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Applications of Hashing

| Field                       | Use Case                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication**          | Password verification, OTP generation.            |
| **Digital Signatures**      | Secure message verification.                      |
| **Blockchain**              | Blocks linked using SHA-256 or Keccak (Ethereum). |
| **Software Updates**        | File verification using checksums.                |
| **Network Security**        | Packet integrity checks.                          |
| **Certificate Authorities** | Fingerprinting public keys.                       |

---

## üîü Security Considerations
* **Collision Attacks**: If two inputs have the same hash, it can break security.

  * MD5 and SHA-1 are **no longer secure**.
* **Brute Force**: If the hash function is too fast, attackers can try many guesses quickly.

  * Use slow hashing for passwords.
* **Rainbow Tables**: Precomputed hash lists used for cracking.

  * Prevented by using **salts**.


* Use **HMAC** for data authentication.
* Choose hash functions with **peer-reviewed security**.

## üîê Salting in Password Hashing

### ‚ûï What is a Salt?

A **salt** is a random value added to the password **before** hashing.

### üîÅ Salted Hashing Flow

```
Input Password + Salt ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Hash Function ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Store (Salt, Hash)
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Without Salt

* Same password ‚Üí Same hash ‚Üí Easy for attackers to guess.

### ‚úÖ With Salt

* Same password ‚Üí Different hash ‚Üí Protects against rainbow tables.

---

## üå∂Ô∏è Peppering (Extra Security)

A **pepper** is a **secret key** stored separately (not in the database) that‚Äôs also added before hashing.

* Example: `Hash(password + salt + pepper)`
* **Adds protection even if database is compromised.**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Hash Collisions (In Detail)

* A **collision** happens when two **different inputs** produce the **same hash**.
* Cryptographic hash functions should make collisions **extremely rare**.
* MD5 and SHA-1 are known to have collisions ‚Äî avoid them.

---

## üì∑ Hashing in Digital Forensics

* Hashing is used to **verify data integrity** in court.
* When investigators clone a hard drive, they compare hashes to confirm **no tampering** occurred.
* Common tools: `SHA-256`, `MD5` (only for validation, not security).

---

## üß† Hashing in Zero-Knowledge Proofs

* In **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**, hashes can help prove that a party knows a secret **without revealing it**.
* Used in **Zcash**, **zk-SNARKs**, and **anonymous authentication** systems.

## üßæ Message Digest, Integrity & Confidentiality

### üìå What is a Message Digest?

* A fixed-size output representing the data.
* Ensures **data integrity** (detects changes).

### üîç Integrity vs. Confidentiality

| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Integrity**       | Ensures data hasn‚Äôt been changed (via hash).                       |
| **Confidentiality** | Ensures data is hidden from unauthorized parties (via encryption). |

‚úÖ **Hash ‚Üí Integrity**

‚úÖ **Encryption ‚Üí Confidentiality**

‚úÖ **Hash + Encrypt ‚Üí Both**

---

## üì§ Sender ‚Üí Receiver Integrity Flow

1. Sender hashes the message ‚Üí gets H.
2. Sends both the message + H.
3. Receiver hashes the received message ‚Üí gets H‚Äô.
4. Compares H and H‚Äô.

   * If they match ‚Üí ‚úÖ Message is intact.
   * If not ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Message was changed.
